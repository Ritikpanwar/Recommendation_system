  This is how the box was delivered. Had this not been a Christmas present and I not working with a short time frame I probably would have returned. But my father in law loves them so, I guess it did it‚Äôs job.

  Decent shoes  overall. Color is spot on,  size a little long in the toe, comfort not great for arch support-just put a support in there, quality overall seems ok. COMPLAINTS: My sense is that these were not ""brand new"". The leather just behind the toe cap was slightly creased right out of the box., and the soles appeared to have had a slight amount of wear. I am a regular Stacy Adams/ Bostonian type of dress shoe buyer, and have never had a pair that the leather was already creased. I think these were a return and re-packaged as new because the wear evidence was slight. I don't fault the manufacturer, but the seller, who I have not reached out to yet Undecided if I will keep or go through the hassle of returning.

  Quedo un poco ancho, pero el material de fabricaci√≥n es bueno, el zapato es de buena calidad. Me siento conforme con la compra

  Definitely a great dress shoe, bought these to replace another much older pair of Stacy adams. I had purchased another shoe from a different brand that was supposedly my size, and it cost a good bit more. Needless to say they weren‚Äôt my size, but these Stacy Adams fit me very very well and i plan to buy another in a different color.

  Love the shoes, as all the other reviews say.. they look great and I do receive tons of compliments on them, plus the price is the most bang fir your buck ive found.I just bought my third pair of them today. Only had to buy them because my last pair I bought have worn through the bottom, while the leather and shoe structure still feels and looks good, the material of the bottom wears out to fast. I bought my last pair in April 2020 and had to buy a new pair November 2020. Although I do wear them EVERYDAY for 8+ hours a day. I still feel they wear to fast.Still my favorite shoe and will continue to wear and purchase them. Also check out the stacy adams belts, they are awesome and match the cognac color very well.

  Left shoe rubbed the heel a little bit with thin dress socks but felt alright with thicker socks

  Wow! Is all I can say. For the price I was expecting a low grade shoe. However it impressed me with its superb shine, everyone at works compliments me on it. After about 6 months the shine wears down but after a good buff and shine it brings it back. Almost comparable to my $300 pair of shoes.
